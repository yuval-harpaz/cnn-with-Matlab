## Deep Learning commentary from a Matlab user
Hi. I am a renegade Psychologist turned all purpose geek. My day job is brain research but by night I play with Convolutional Neural Networks. Here I post insights I get along the way. At this point you will not see here breakthroughs or innovation, only a user's perspective on how artificial neural networks work, in oppose to actual neural networks do (presuming you have some of those inside the skull, written in python or not).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/cnn-with-Matlab/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yuval-harpaz/cnn-with-Matlab/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
